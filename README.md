Made with the purpose of learning OpenCV.

Start it by running ./run on your terminal.

You can change setting by running as: 
 
 	./run <cameraIdx> <width> <height> <sensitivity> <debugging> 
 
 	cameraIdx - index of camera to use (default: 0) 
 	width, height - width and height of camera resolution (default: 800x600)
 	sensitivity - inverted sensitivity, lower makes change detector more sensible (default : 15)
 	debugging - set to 1 to see image processing (default: 0)

Enjoy!
